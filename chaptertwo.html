        <h1 id="chapter_one_title">Chapter 2</h1>
        <p class="mx-5">There was the day you knew your life was a lie, and the day you let yourself know.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">The day you knew, Tracy Chapman would not leave you the fuck alone. Some people hear "stay-at-home mom" and think "lots of free time" not "endless unpaid labor for a boss that launches Spaghetti O's at your face."</p>
        <p class="mx-5">Tracy Chapman lived across the street, in a two-story colonial beast with a balcony she seemed to always be on whenever you were gardening. As you sorted through weeds and mulch on your knees, hands aching in thick gardening gloves, she hovered above you, waving from her perch with a wine glass in hand like a royal wielding a scepter. <em>Beautiful morning!</em> She would yell.</p>
        <p class="mx-5"><em>Go fuck yourself</em>, you would think.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">Tracy paid people to do her garden. People with machines whose knees and wrists will never get arthritis. She'd do it herself, but she's always <em>so</em> tired by the end of the workweek, you know? She worked at a bank, working Cross-Functionally with Executive Stakeholders to deliver Deliverables. Important ones.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">You rarely saw Mark Chapman, Tracy's husband, who had some high-ranking scientist job involving mitochondria in bananas or something. But Tracy seemed to be everywhere—hosting block parties or raising money for the elementary school playground to be redone with that squishy asphalt. Her two sons were in high school and the highlight of every celebratory function; award ceremonies felt incestuous. Her life was so Busy and so Managed.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">Meanwhile, your daughter screamed. Stains appeared on your clothes like ghosts of days survived, not conquered. And for one spectacularly horrible week, every single interaction you had started with an apology for something rescheduled, forgotten, or fucked up.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">For the first few years after moving, you tried. Three years of fighting to rally, bake, organize with the best of them. The harder you tried, the worse you did, and the better she seemed to be, as if she was rerouting your efforts in an energetic liposuction. You don't know how many nights you spent crying in your husband's arms, feeling pathetic at feeling pathetic.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">So after your daughter's Terrible Two's turned into Shit Three's, you gave up. Said no to everything. Dropped out of the neighborhood's parents association, showed up late to the events you didn't skip altogether. You just couldn't do it anymore. But the calls, requests, invites, "could you"'s, and "do you mind"'s didn't stop. Tracy Chapman was either too dumb to notice the change after a year and a half, or loved rubbing your failure to keep up in your face.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">And Tracy Chapman was not dumb.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">So there it was, another knock, the <em>tap tap tap</em> of her hand against the wooden door and into the hinges of your jaw. Tracy wanted you to go to local businesses to find sponsors for town's annual 10k. First, she cornered you in the grocery store as you debated between three different varieties of goat cheese spreads, like someone with a beating heart. Then she CC'ed you in an email, and called you twice, leaving a voicemail each time. It's just <em>so</em> important, <em>so</em> great for the community that we <em>all</em> benefit from, and Tracy would love to do it, of course, but things were so busy with Work, the Deliverables must be delivered, you must remember?</p>
        <p class="mx-5"><em>Fuck off.</em></p>
        <p class="mx-5">Which is what you were walking down the hall to tell her, in some passive aggressive way that would make her feel like a bad mother, in exchange for her implying you're shitting on your daughter's future by not representing women in the work force. If <em>Tracy</em> knew the truth of who you were, and what real female power flowed through your veins, she'd shit herself.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">You heard a scream.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">You broke out into a run down the hallway. Tension floods down your body and your heart stutters, not knowing what you'll find as you enter the living room.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">You took in everything in fragments, your eyes straining wide to see <em>more</em>, find what's wrong in the picture: your couch, sagging; toys still littering the wood floor; coffee table, scuffed and stained. The family goldfish swims happily in his glass bowl on a stand in front of the big picture window, your favorite thing about this house. Your husband held the front door open, his tall, broad shoulders almost keeping Tracy out of view. Everything is fine, nothing is broken. You exhale.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">And then you see her.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">She's on her back, as if a gust of wind shoved her backwards onto the pavement leading up to your house. Her bun—always perfect, not a hair out of place—was lopsided, hair jerkily freed from its tight grasp. Tears stained her cheeks black with mascara, her eyes fixed solely on your husband.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">It's only for a moment, before he shuts the door. But you saw it, you know you saw it, and your stomach drops at what you rush to tell yourself you don't feel, you don't smell.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">Your husband, who turned to face you, and smiled. It was the same, slightly lopsided grin he'd given you the first time he'd made you orgasm. Pleased with himself.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">"Handled, darling." He said.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">"Thank you," you said back. Your throat was cracky and a part of you you'd suppressed your whole life stirred.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">He walked past you and gave you a peck on the cheek on his way to read in your daughter's room while she slept for her afternoon nap. She loved seeing her father first thing when she woke up. Practically the only time she smiled, seeing him with some large accounting tome in his hands. Afterwards he would play tea time, for hours, so you could get in your own afternoon nap or take a luxuriously long bath. He was the best father, the best husband. You were lucky. You had to remember that.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">Things are never right out of context. His eyes had always taken on a golden quality when hit with direct light. It was unusual—sexy. You'd always loved his eyes. And Tracy? So dramatic. She had to do the most, all the time. You can see her damn running off your property in her Louis Vuitton's through the picture window. Bet your sad Mom shoes looked pretty great right now.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">What a look on her face—he must have said something really horrible to bring her near tears like that. He went too far maybe, you should talk to him, but that protective nature is part of why you love him. "There's my girl," he'd say into your hair when you rolled into his arms in the morning. Could you blame him? Tracy could afford to be knocked a few pegs off her tower. The way she walks on that balcony.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">What a look—righteous shock. Indignation, even.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">Not alarm, no. Certainly not panic.</p>
        <p class="mx-5">Not terror.</p>
